## Object Detection 
This page contains articles explaining concepts and code behind object detection. Living doc, trying to keep a sense of dates so that older resources can fall out of date appropriately.
Will gather more here in the future, especially around newer model SOTA architectures.

- Feb 2019 - detailed documented use of TF obj detection API.
https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-your-own-object-detector-ad69dda69c85

- TF obj detection tutorial. Uses pre-trained model to detect objects in an image.
https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb

- July 2018 article from Sara about mobile & TPUs: 
https://medium.com/tensorflow/training-and-serving-a-realtime-mobile-object-detector-in-30-minutes-with-cloud-tpus-b78971cf1193

- Nov 2018 "Object Detection using TensorFlow and COCO Pre-Trained Models": https://mc.ai/object-detection-using-tensorflow-and-coco-pre-trained-models/

- TF docs on "Distributed Training on the Oxford-IIIT Pets Dataset on Google Cloud". 
Pretty useful for getting up and running, though as of early 2020 it was still using TF 1.X, tf.slim, and Py27, 
which made for some confusion: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md

- GCP object detection example (pretrained only): https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-object-detection-example

- TF docs on using a custom dataset: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/using_your_own_dataset.md

- missinglink.ai resource, not sure how long this will stay up since they're shutting down. May need to look at a mirror: https://missinglink.ai/guides/tensorflow/tensorflow-image-recognition-object-detection-api-two-quick-tutorials/
